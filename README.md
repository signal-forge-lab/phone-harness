# Phone Harness 📱

Connect an LLM directly to your real iPhone with a thin, editable harness.
No jailbreak and no WebDriverAgent.

The harness now has two host transports:

- **macOS** — iPhone Mirroring + Apple Vision OCR + CGEvents.
- **Windows** — `pymobiledevice3` CoreDevice + local PaddleOCR PP-OCRv6 +
  Universal HID.

On macOS the iPhone Mirroring window is the transport. On Windows the harness
talks to the real phone over Apple's USB/CoreDevice services through
`pymobiledevice3`. In both cases the agent works from screenshots, local OCR and
tap-ready coordinates; screenshots only need a vision model when OCR cannot
describe an icon or ambiguous visual state.

```
  ● agent: wants to open Weather
  │
  ● ocr() → "Weather" at (400, 468)
  │
  ● tap(400, 468) → wait_stable() → ocr() confirms the forecast
  ✓ done
```

**Your phone, driven by an agent.**

## Setup

### Windows

Use Python 3.12 and install the Windows prerequisites described in
[`install.md`](install.md). The minimal verified environment is:

```bat
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install pymobiledevice3
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install paddlepaddle==3.2.0 -i https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/packages/stable/cpu/
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install paddleocr==3.7.0
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e . --no-deps
.venv\Scripts\phone-harness.exe --doctor
```

The Windows backend deliberately keeps `pymobiledevice3` as an external
dependency instead of copying or vendoring its GPL-3.0-or-later source into
this MIT repository.

### macOS

Paste into Claude Code or Codex:

```text
Set up phone-harness for me. Clone https://github.com/ShawnPana/phone-harness
into ~/.phone-harness (its canonical home) and read `install.md` first to install
it and connect it to my real iPhone
through the macOS iPhone Mirroring app — install it so `phone-harness` is a
command on my PATH, and register it as an agent skill named phone-harness using
`phone-harness skill` as the body, so you reach for it automatically. Then read
`SKILL.md` for normal usage, and always read `src/phone_harness/helpers.py`
because that is where the functions are. Whenever you capture or verify the
screen, activate the iPhone Mirroring window so I can see what you're doing on
the phone.

Setup needs two things only I can do: pairing iPhone Mirroring with my phone
once, and granting the terminal Accessibility + Screen Recording in System
Settings — walk me through those and wait for me. Verify with
`./phone-harness --doctor`.

After it's installed, as a quick demo that interaction works, go to my Home
Screen and — if the phone is connected and unlocked — ask me whether you should
open the Weather app as a harmless test; only open it if I say yes. If the
session is paused or the phone is locked, just tell me the doctor status instead.
```

The agent will walk you through the two things only you can do: **pairing**
iPhone Mirroring with your phone once (the pairing prompts need the physical
phone), and granting the terminal **Accessibility** (taps & keystrokes) and
**Screen Recording** (seeing the phone) in System Settings → Privacy &
Security. Screen Recording takes effect after the terminal restarts;
Accessibility is immediate. Then `./phone-harness --doctor` verifies the whole
chain.

These are the permissions currently known to be required. A fresh machine may
prompt for more the first time an action runs — if `--doctor` passes but taps or
capture silently do nothing, watch for a macOS permission prompt. See
[install.md](install.md) for details.

## Why this works

On **macOS**, iPhone Mirroring (Sequoia+) renders the phone as a Mac window and
forwards real mouse and keyboard input as touches.

On **Windows**, current `pymobiledevice3` exposes CoreDevice screen capture,
display information, Universal HID tap/drag, named HID buttons and a printable
ASCII virtual keyboard. The harness converts screenshot pixels to CoreDevice's
0..65535 HID coordinate space at the input boundary.

That gives an agent the same three primitives on either host:

- **See** — capture the phone and OCR locally. macOS uses Apple Vision; Windows
  uses PaddleOCR PP-OCRv6 medium. Every visible string has a tap-ready center.
- **Act** — macOS uses CGEvents; Windows uses CoreDevice Universal HID.
- **Verify** — screenshot again. No DOM means the capture is the ground truth.

macOS-specific things that do NOT work, learned the hard way: AppleScript `click at` (silently
ignored — the window is a video stream with no accessibility tree), unicode key
payloads (mirroring forwards raw HID keycodes, so typing must use keycodes), a
slow touch-drag (barely moves an iOS list — use wheel scroll for lists, a fast
flick for pages), and input while the window isn't frontmost (swallowed).

## Usage

```bash
./phone-harness <<'PY'
open_app("Notes")
tap_text("New Note")
type_text("hello from the harness")
print([o["text"] for o in ocr()][:10])
PY
```

Day-to-day workflow lives in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md), which [install.md](install.md)
registers as an agent skill (`phone-harness skill` prints the body) so the agent
reaches for it on its own.

## Architecture

- `SKILL.md` — day-to-day usage (the agent-facing product surface)
- `install.md` — permissions bootstrap and troubleshooting
- `src/phone_harness/` — protected core:
  - `mirror.py` — window discovery, focus, capture, CGEvent input
  - `ocr.py` — Vision-framework text recognition → screen-point boxes
  - `windows.py` — Windows CoreDevice screenshot/input transport
  - `paddle_ocr.py` — PP-OCRv6 local OCR → screenshot-pixel boxes
  - `helpers.py` — the primitives pre-imported into scripts
  - `admin.py` — `--doctor`
  - `run.py` — the CLI (`exec` stdin with helpers in scope)
- `agent-workspace/agent_helpers.py` — helper code the agent edits; auto-loaded
  into every script's namespace

The mirror transport is stateless (window bounds and captures are re-queried per
call), so there is no daemon — every invocation is self-contained.

## Development

From a checkout, use `./phone-harness` to run the working tree directly:

```bash
./phone-harness <<'PY'
print(screen_info())
PY
```

## Limits

- One phone, one active session.
- Windows MVP targets iOS 17.4+ over USB; earlier iOS 17 releases can require a
  privileged `tunneld` path.
- Windows direct typing currently supports printable ASCII only.
- `app_switcher()` is not part of the Windows MVP; `home()` and `open_app()` are.
- On macOS, unlocking the physical phone pauses mirroring.
- No multi-touch (no pinch), no camera/Face ID flows, DRM video renders black.
- OCR sees text, not semantics — unlabeled icons need a screenshot + a
  vision-capable model.
